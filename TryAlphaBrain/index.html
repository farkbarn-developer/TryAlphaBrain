			<p class="txtstayp">Staying <a href="redirect.html">productive</a> has never been so hard. Notifications from Whatsapp, Instagram, Snapchat, and more are making people more distracted than ever.</p>
			<p class="txtstayp">Many people feel like they’re doing a hundred things at once, but leave the office feeling like they got nothing done. Well, it’s got a lot to do with shrinking concentration spans. In fact, <strong>a Microsoft study found people’s attention spans have plummeted 33% in just two decades.</strong> (1)</p>
			<p class="txtstayp">Being distracted and unfocused is not something to shrug off. It can jeopardize people’s ability to hit their work targets and put them at risk of blowing their chances of a promotion. Even worse, it can mean losing out to coworkers who can <a href="redirect.html">stay focused and get stuff done</a>.</p>
			<p class="txtstayp"><strong>While some people waste hours scrolling endlessly through Instagram, others are finding ways to <a href="redirect.html">hack their brains to achieve optimal productivity</a></strong>, almost at will.</p>

		</section>
		<section class="txtone">
			<p class="txtonep">One of the ways many people are seeking to <a href="redirect.html">achieve optimal productivity</a> is by getting into a <strong>‘flow state’</strong>. <super>(2)</super> At this point you may be thinking, "What is a flow state?" To put it simply, it's when the brain is hyper-focused, in the zone, and can power through tasks for hours straight.</p>
			<p class="txtonep">But to <a href="redirect.html">achieve a flow state</a>, the brain needs to be at the right frequency. This frequency is when ‘alpha waves’ appear.</p>
			<p class="txtonep">As reported in Psychology Today, neuroscientists have found alpha waves help to <a href="redirect.html">enhance mood, creativity, and concentration</a>. Until recently, the only way to trigger alpha waves was through sending electrical pulses through the brain or deep meditation.</p>

				<p class="txtbrainp2">If you want your brain to work better, you need to concentrate on two things: getting it to make more alpha waves, and supporting the production of neurotransmitters,† chemicals that relay information in and from the brain. Alpha BRAIN® was formulated with both goals in mind.</p>
				<p class="txtbrainp2">With its trademarked ingredient blends, Alpha BRAIN® builds an environment in which the brain can operate on all cylinders, and protects its functioning for lasting mental clarity.†</p>
